## Bringing ERC721 to TikTok content creators.

### Demo:
- NFTs have been minted and viewable on opensea.io (Rinkeby)
- Check out the external links below the NFT images for the original TikTok videos.
- Check out their properties as well.

### Project vulnerability:
- Videos are currently stored on arbitrary hosting services. Will migrate to IPFS for permanent storage.
- We envision having data right disputes with TikTok. With wisdom, we envision resolving those disputes and co-create a new fertile ground for digital art creation and collection.

### Todo after EthDenver:
- Build-in sales % cut going to original content creators => further incentivizing content creation and more collectors onboarding.
- Create contract-based accounts (shout out to James Young) for wallet-less content creators
- Upload videos to IPFS via Textile Bucket
- Really, the only limit is our imagination.
